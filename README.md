# Kosha Airtable Connector

Airtable is a spreadsheet-database hybrid, with the features of a database but applied to a spreadsheet. The fields in an Airtable table are similar to cells in a spreadsheet, but have types such as 'checkbox', 'phone number', and 'drop-down list', and can reference file attachments like images.

Users can create a database, set up column types, add records, link tables to one another, collaborate, sort records and publish views to external websites.


The connector APIs allow you to perform 'RESTful' operations such as reading, modifying, adding or deleting data from your airtable. The APIs also support Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS).

This Connector API exposes REST API endpoints to perform any operations on Airtable v0 API in a simple, quick and intuitive fashion.

It describes various API operations, related request and response structures, and error codes.

## Build

To build the project binary, run
```
    go build -o main .

```

## Run locally

To run the project, simply provide env variables to supply the API key and authentication bearer token domain name.


```bash
go build -o main .
API_KEY=<API_KEY> DOMAIN_NAME=<DOMAIN_NAME> ./main
```

This will start a worker and expose the API on port `8012` on the host machine

Swagger docs is available at `https://localhost:8012/docs`

## Generating Swagger Documentation

To generate `swagger.json` and `swagger.yaml` files based on the API documentation, simple run -

```bash
go install github.com/swaggo/swag/cmd/swag@latest
swag init -g main.go --parseDependency --parseInternal
```

To generate OpenAPISpec version 3 from Swagger 2.0 specification, run -

```bash
npm i api-spec-converter
npx api-spec-converter --from=swagger_2 --to=openapi_3 --syntax=json ./docs/swagger.json > openapi.json
```
