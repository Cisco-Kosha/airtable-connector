# Kosha Airtable Connector

With Airtable you can create spreadsheets that function like databases. 

The Kosha Airtable connecter enables you to perform REST API operations from the Airtable API in your Kosha workflow or custom application. Using the Kosha Airtable connecter, you can directly access the Airtable platform to:

* Create bases (or databases)
* Add records
* Integrate your Airtable data with any external system

## Useful Actions 

You can use the Kosha Airtable connector to manage records, tables, fields, and bases.

Refer to the Kosha Airtable connector [API specification](openapi.json) for details.

### Managing Records

A record is an individual unit in a table. Use the Airtable connector to create, manage and delete records.

### Managing Fields

Fields are the units in records you use to store custom data. Use the Airtable connector to create and update fields.

### Managing Tables

Tables are structural units that enable you to consistently store your Airtable data. 

### Managing Bases

In Airtable a base—or database—is central place to store your data, including tables. You can use the connector to list, get, and create bases. 

## Authentication

To authenticate when provisioning the Kosha Airtable connector, you need your [personal access token](https://airtable.com/developers/web/guides/personal-access-tokens) tied to your associated scopes.
