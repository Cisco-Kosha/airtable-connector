# Kosha Airtable Connector

With Airtable you can create spreadsheets that function like databases. The fields in an Airtable table are similar to cells in a spreadsheet but have types such as 'checkbox', 'phone number', and 'drop-down list', and the cells can reference file attachments, such as images.

You can create a database, set up column types, add records, link tables to one another, collaborate, sort records, and publish views to external websites.
